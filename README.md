Some ways to test the model are:

Plot the input and output data before and after the feedback loop to see how they change over time.
Compare the model performance with and without the feedback loop using different metrics such as MSE, R2, or MAE.
Experiment with different values of the feedback factor and see how they affect the model convergence and stability.
Analyze the impact of the feedback loop on the model bias and variance using techniques such as cross-validation or bootstrap.
